# Tableau-Project-on-Hotel-Booking-Analysis
Introduction:

The Hotel Booking Analysis project in Tableau aims to gain insights into customer behavior and the factors influencing hotel booking decisions. The dataset includes information about customers, hotels, and reservations, such as arrival and departure dates, number of guests, booking cancellations, and more. The project focuses on three main sections: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Cancellation Analysis, and Revenue Analysis. By analyzing these aspects, we aim to understand customer preferences and provide valuable insights for hotels to improve revenue and reduce cancellations.

Objective:

The objective of this project is to analyze hotel booking data and uncover key insights related to customer behavior and factors influencing booking decisions. Specifically, the project aims to achieve the following goals:

Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of variables and identify any outliers or missing values.
Analyze factors influencing booking cancellations and understand their impact on the overall booking process.
Analyze revenue patterns and explore the average daily rate (ADR) to understand revenue generation by hotels.
Provide actionable insights to hotels based on the findings to improve revenue, reduce cancellations, and enhance guest satisfaction.

Data Summary:

The dataset used in this project contains various variables related to hotel bookings, including customer information, hotel details, reservation attributes, and booking status. Variables such as lead time, arrival date, number of nights stayed, guest demographics, meal type, market segment, and room types are included in the dataset. This comprehensive data allows us to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences.

Approach:

The project begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset. This involves examining the distribution of variables, identifying outliers, and detecting any missing values. By visualizing the data, we gain insights into the booking patterns, preferred room types, length of stay, and demand trends across different months.

The project then focuses on analyzing the factors affecting booking cancellations. This involves exploring variables such as lead time, previous cancellations, and room type preferences to understand their impact on cancellations. We also investigate the influence of factors like waiting period and assigned room type on booking cancellations.

Next, the revenue analysis section explores the average daily rate (ADR) to understand the revenue generated by hotels. We examine the ADR trends throughout the year and analyze the impact of demand on pricing. This helps us identify peak periods for revenue generation and understand the overall revenue performance of the hotels.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the Hotel Booking Analysis project successfully explores the dataset to gain valuable insights into customer behavior and factors affecting hotel bookings. The project provides insights into preferred room types, length of stay, demand patterns, cancellation factors, and revenue trends.

The findings of the project can be utilized by hotels to make data-driven decisions, enhance revenue, and improve guest satisfaction. Recommendations can be made based on the analysis, such as increasing the availability of popular room types, addressing cancellation factors, and optimizing pricing strategies during peak demand periods. The project highlights the importance of data analysis in understanding customer behavior and drawing meaningful conclusions to drive business success in the hotel industry.
